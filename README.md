# Bangazon Workforce Management Site

Your team is reponsible for building an internal application for our human resources and IT departments. The application will allow them to create, list, and view Employees, Training Programs, Departments, and Computers.

You will be building an ASP.NET Web Application using Visual Studio on Windows, using SQL Server as the database engine. You will be learning the Razor templating syntax. You will be learning how to use view models for defining the data to be used in a Razor template. You will also be learning the concept of integration testing. Your tests will perform GET and POST requests to your application and verify that each view works as expected.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
1. Copy `BangazonWorkforce/BangazonWorkforce/appsettings.json.example` as `BangazonWorkforce/BangazonWorkforce/appsettings.json`
1. Copy `BangazonWorkforce/BangazonWorkforce.IntegrationTests/Config.cs.example` as `BangazonWorkforce/BangazonWorkforce.IntegrationTests/Config.cs`

Open both of those files and put in the SQL Server connection strings in the placeholder.

After that, you're ready to start coding.
